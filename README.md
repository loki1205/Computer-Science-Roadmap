# Computer-Science-Roadmap
It is a roadmap for Indian Tier-3 or lower students who want to achieve big.
I myself am a lower tier college student and so, I do not know if it is useful for other Tier 1 and Tier 2 students.
These are all my knowledge and opinion.
You can also change or edit things on your own if you wish to. It totally depends on your pace of learning.
This roadmap is suitable for me and my friends and my juniors depending on our situations.
If you want to move fastest or you are in 3rd year or 4th year of college. This plan might not suit you.
